            <p>The Halo Chain began with the simple idea to deliver Halloween-themed goodie bags to the patients at Dell Children’s Center in October of 2021. Originally, the goal was to delivery twenty goodie bags with a fundraising goal of $100. By the end of the week, over $1,000 were donated and we were able to put together 360 goodie bags — enough for every single child at the hospital!</p>
            <p>In January of 2021, we worked with the Texas Sweethearts, a spirit organization at the University of Texas at Austin, to put together Valentine’s Day themed activity books for a delivery on February 14th. Each child is set to receive a folder with coloring pages, puzzles, stickers, and colored pencils. We can’t wait to make this delivery!</p>
            <p>The Halo Chain also hosts numerous fundraising efforts, and we plan to grow them even more in 2022! Some events to look out for include a field day, a bake sale, donation bingo, and a 5K!</p>
